This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

The project is born of our motivation to challenge ourselves. Not only did we try to make an electronic project, but we also implemented some mechanics, wich was not trivial for the IC students that we are. This website is here to show you our work, as well as guidelines to build this on your own and how to take over the project for improvements.
